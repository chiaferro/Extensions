# Beyond KeyBERT: Topic Modeling Extensions

This repository contains two advanced extensions for the [KeyBERT](https://github.com/MaartenGr/KeyBERT) framework, developed as part of a Deep NLP project at the Polytechnic of Turin.

## Extensions

### 1 Ablation Study – Candidate Filtering
- Dataset: CNN/DailyMail summaries (via Hugging Face)
- Goal: Evaluate KeyBERT with vs. without syntactic candidate filtering
- Output: Precision, Jaccard overlap, keyword length comparison
- Notebook: `ablation_study.ipynb`

### 2 Semantic Enrichment – WordNet Expansion
- Dataset: BBC News articles
- Goal: Improve topic coverage via synonym expansion of extracted keywords
- Output: Coverage scores, enriched keyword sets
- Notebook: `wordnet_enrichment.ipynb`
